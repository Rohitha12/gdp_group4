# Health and Wellness App

## Purpose :

Have you ever wondered how healthy you are or how's your daily activity cycle ?

Every person is always busy or tend to forget to maintain their calorie or water intake and might also have an unhealthy sleep cycle which impacts their health. To maintain one's daily basic health activites , we are proposing an application , "Health and Wellness" which helps the user to track activities like amount of sleep,step count, consumtion of calories and hydration levels. Food habits of every user vary and they might not know how many calories they are consuming or burning. we'll help them to monitor their data by taking the user input.

## Overview :

Using this app, the user can monitor their activity and understand how they can improve or manage daily activities. Every user can set a personal goal for each activity and see if they can reach it or not. They can accept challenges created by admins and also can create their own challenge among their friends or groups.
