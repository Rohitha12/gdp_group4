## 08/24/2020 Half Day 1 Work - 4 hours

- We have set-up a zoom call to discuss the ideas for our app and have divided the tasks for team-mates to complete the work in time. Our Project manager assigned tasks for each individual where I am responsible to design the interface sketches of the app layout.

- I have given a rough sketch of our app layout and proposed some of the basic screen designs in the app like login page and sign up page.

- I have worked on the profile design layout and Home screen layout of the app which consists of multiple activities. On Home screen, you can click on their activities which take you to a new page to show a detailed content of the health activity being monitored. Every health activity will have an user input button to manually enter data.
